## Up and running
- Install dependencies
- Export environment
- Start server
- Please visit API [repo](https://github.com/sweaty-figs/sweaty-figs-db) for instructions on setting up api for data layer.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

> You are now running locally on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Requirements

- React
- Redux
- Node 0.10.x // TODO: what version?
- Webpack 1.11.0
- Postgres 9.5.2.0
- Nodal 0.1.0

Please see this [repo](https://github.com/sweaty-figs/sweaty-figs-db) for information about requirments and set up for the API driving our data layer.

## Development

To build webpack and generate a bundle:
From within the root directory:
```sh
npm start
```

## Deployment
To generate docs:
```sh
npm start doc
```
Refer to http://en.blog.koba04.com/2015/06/28/esdoc-documentation-for-react-and-es6/ for how to

## Unstacking the stack

_**Day Voyage is a Single Page Application built with:**_
- React (drives user driven client side interface)
- Redux (application state management)
- React Router and Redux Router (client side routing)

### React
- Views are created using modular and reusable components built in React/JSX.
- React components implement one-way reactive data flow to immediately rerender views upon changes.

### React Router
- Day Voyage uses the React Router library for dynamic route matching to keep our UI in sync with the URL.
- URL paths are synced seamlessly with React view components and allows for smooth transition between page routes.

### Redux
- Unidirectional data-flow normalizes data and provides predictability
- Manages states and acts as a single source of truth for data shared by components throughout the application
- Utilized in conjunction with local states to preserve modularity
- Snapshot of application state tree:
  - **activities:** results from Yelp API call
  - **auth:** stores web tokens and user information
  - **dashboard:** stores user created plans (itineraries)
  - **data:** loading information and miscellaneous items (i.e. budget)
  - **dbactivities:** results from database api call for activities
  - **directions:** stores map coordinates of activities
  - **planBuilder:** temporary list of activities that the user is creating before sa**ving the** the database
  - **router:** keeps track of react router history and location change

### Node
- Day Voyage utilizes Node.js for its extensive package ecosystem through npm, including React and other libraries.

###### Express
- Day Voyage is served using Express, which provides server-side routing and an enviornment for executing API calls to the database and external APIs.
- Utilizes middleware such as body-parser for requests and webpack-dev-middleware to serve our Webpack assets.

## API's
The data powering our app

###### [Day Voyage API](https://github.com/sweaty-figs/sweaty-figs-db)
- Built with Nodal and Postgres
- See linked repo for endpoints and schemas
- **[Postgress](http://www.postgresql.org)**
  - Our solution for the relational nature of the data
  - Recommended to use [Postgress.app](http://postgresapp.com) for mac users
- **[Nodal](http://www.nodaljs.com)**
  - Our server interfacing with the Postgres instance
  - Separating our API from the application server decouples concerns of the cient and data

###### [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) _External API_
- Day Voyage utilizes the **Yelp Search API** to supplement user-generated activities with local establishments based on your search query in the city of your choosing.

###### [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps) _External API_
- **Google Maps** - Implemented using the React-Google-Maps library. Day Voyage generates all search points on the map and creates routes between activities in a plan based on the order of activities set.
- **Google Geocoding** - When geolocation search is activated, Google Geocoding is used to translate the coordinates from latitude/longitude to a city name, so it can be implemented as a location query for our database and the Yelp Search API.
- **Google Distance Matrix** - allows for searches based on geolocation. All activities in the application include the distance from the user's location in miles.
